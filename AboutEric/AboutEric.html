    <h1>About Eric</h1>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Eric "The Ric" Macpherson was born on March 18th 2005. He attends Queens University in Kingston Ontario.
       He is Wingmanned by nobody else than New Brunswick's very own Noah "L.L Bean" Lafferty. Both Eric and Noah
       can be regularly seen at Virtue nighclub in Kingston. The infamous pickup line "Have you met my friend Eric", 
       Developed and honed to perfection by Noah himself was executed on many "birds". This technique is now deemed
       forbidden, as it has resulted in Eric's aquisition of too many "birds". This is due to Eric's undenayable charm
       and game.
